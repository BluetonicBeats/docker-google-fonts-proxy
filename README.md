# Google Fonts proxy shipped as a Docker image for GDPR-compliant usage

Recently, several GDPR Data Protection Authorities restricted the usage of Google Fonts in websites
receiving visits from European Union residents.

These new restrictions make it more illegal to use Google Fonts directly. This proxy is a plug-and-play
replacement for Google Fonts that can be hosted on a custom domain to proxy Google Fonts and thus comply
with GDPR (as no personal data will be transfered to Google Fonts).
